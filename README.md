# Random_Prime_number_generator
This python code generates a random prime number of 2048 bits.
In computational number theory, a variety of algorithms make it possible to generate prime numbers efficiently. These are used in various applications, for example hashing, public-key cryptography, and search of prime factors in large numbers.

For relatively small numbers, it is possible to just apply trial division to each successive odd number. 
For the large primes used in cryptography, we generate probable primes with the Millerâ€“Rabin primality test.
